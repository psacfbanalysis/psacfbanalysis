# PSAC-Football-Analysis
⚠️ Postmortem note from John: After discussing the roadmap with Justin, we are planning to strip the project down to its core features, likely swapping the web interface for a desktop GUI (e.g., Tkinter). We are officially cutting the custom domain and Vercel hosting to eliminate cost overhead for seats. If we do decide to keep a web component, we will move to a cost-effective solution like GitHub Pages on a different Github account I will link (for purposes of displaying the repo to the future cohorts of those taking CMSC 480 at CU-Bloomsburg).
